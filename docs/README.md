# SafeCrowd

**Real-Time Crowd Anomaly Detection and Automated Security Alert System**

An AI-driven early warning system that monitors live CCTV feeds in high-density
public spaces (transit hubs, temples, stadiums, commercial centers) and
automatically alerts security personnel when crowd behavior turns dangerous —
surges, bottlenecks, or sudden erratic dispersal.

## How it works (one paragraph)

Live camera frames are run through a YOLO detector fine-tuned for dense crowds,
ByteTrack assigns each person a persistent ID across frames, and from those
trajectories we compute zone-wise density, flow direction, and velocity
variance. When those metrics cross anomaly thresholds, an alert fires over
WebSocket to a ReactJS dashboard with camera coordinates, a snapshot, and a
severity score.

## Architecture (3-tier)

```
Perception Tier   → YOLOv8 person detection
Analytics Tier    → ByteTrack trajectory tracking + density/flow/velocity math
Alerting Tier     → Threshold rules → WebSocket push → Dashboard + SMS/Email/Siren
```
